# rpmbuild is used to build both binary and source software packages. A package consists of an archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file attributes, and descriptive information about the package. Packages # come in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages, containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce binary packages.

# Build binary and source packages (after doing the %prep, %build, and %install stages).
rpmbuild -ba hello-world.spec

# Build a binary package (after doing the %prep, %build, and %install stages).
rpmbuild -bb hello-world.spec

# The spectool utility from the rpmdevtools package can do this. Just install rpmdevtools and point spectools at the .spec like so:
# It will download any missing sources into rpm's %{_sourcedir} (usually SOURCES) directory.
spectool -g -R SPECS/nginx.spec


# Prerequisites
yum install gcc rpm-build rpm-devel rpmlint make python bash coreutils diffutils patch rpmdevtools
