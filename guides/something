### if you faced problem when pushed into github/gitlab RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 413

you need to add "client_max_body_size 30g" in nginx.conf:

server {
        server_name  someserver;

        location / {
          client_max_body_size 30g;
        }

### if you've gitlab and behind nginx for proxy, and your images not displayed, then you need add proxy_set_header
    server {
        server_name  someserver;

        location / {

          proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
          proxy_pass http://somserver/;
        }
